// The FACEPLATE: the selected block as a small unit of the PR7 line, beside
// its controls on the PROCESSOR page (where the RIG BROWSER and SELECTED
// RIG panels were), as on the PR7-V and PR7-G. Built only from the PR7's own parts,
// in the current finish: the unit's pearl chassis, its LCD screens, big
// knobs, small keys with light stripes, neon LED bars, and lettering
// stamped in ink or printed in red. It shows what the block is doing, live:
//
//   OD / DIST   the MODEL's name (OBSIDIAN or GOTHAM) and what it is; its
//               knobs and switches as on its panel (OBSIDIAN's MOD between
//               ALPHA and OMEGA, GROWL and BITE on keys); SPLIT on a key with
//               its frequency and LOWS; the bass's level going in, in LED bars.
//   NAMP        the loaded model's name and details on a screen (or that
//               none is loaded, or why it failed); RIG LEVEL and PRESENCE;
//               NORMALISE on a key; the level going in.
//   CABINET IR  the IR's name and length, and its frequency response as a
//               curve (what the cab does to the tone).
//   PITCH       the OCTAVER's four voices and FREEZE's level as faders;
//               TUNING on a screen; keys for OCTAVER and FREEZE, lit while on.
//   COMP / GATE Classic: a gain-reduction needle, THRESHOLD, RATIO, LEVEL,
//               GATE. Daybreak: COMP, DETAIL, MIX knobs, INTENSITY on a key,
//               GATE, gain reduction in LED bars.
//   DELAY       its TYPE as the name; the repeats laid out in time, fading
//               by FEEDBACK, a light running along them at the delay time;
//               TIME in seven-segment digits; FEEDBACK and MIX knobs.
//   REVERB      its TYPE as the name; the reverb's shape (pre-delay, then
//               the tail as long as it decays); DECAY in seconds; SIZE, MIX.
//   MOD         its TYPE as the name; the wobble at RATE and DEPTH with a
//               dot riding it; RATE in digits; the TYPE's own knobs (AEON's
//               MANUAL and RES).
//   FILTER /    its TYPE; the auto-wah's or talk box's peak, as sharp as
//   PITCH       RESONANCE, or the interval or program; its knobs.
//   GLITCH      its MODE; a 16-step pattern as dense as DENSITY, a light
//               stepping at LENGTH; LENGTH in digits; DENSITY and MIX.
//   GRAPHIC EQ  the EQ's own response curve (ULTRA LO and ULTRA HI included);
//               LEVEL; ULTRA LO and ULTRA HI on keys.
//   LO-FI       its TYPE; a wave showing what AMOUNT and NOISE do; AMOUNT, MIX.
//   (the generic unit, name, icon and TYPE, is kept for any block added later)
