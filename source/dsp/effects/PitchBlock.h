    // The PITCH block, first in the chain, before anything else touches the
    // guitar (as these pedals sit at the start of a real board):
    //
    //   TUNING   virtual retuning: the whole guitar shifted by -12 to +12
    //            semitones, as if every string were tuned down (or capoed
    //            up). -2 plays standard-tuned riffs a whole step down (D
    //            standard), -5 in B. Every string moves together: it can't
    //            drop one string alone, as drop D does. 0 is off: the guitar
    //            passes untouched.
    //   OCTAVER  a POG-style octave pedal: the guitar two octaves down, one
    //            octave down, as it is, and one octave up, each with its own
    //            level, so you can blend organ-like stacks. The shifters
    //            work on the whole sound, so chords track too (with a little
    //            shimmer on dense chords).
    //   FREEZE   holds what you just played as an endless pad: switch it on
    //            and the last moment of playing is caught and sustained,
    //            smoothly, while you play over it. ATTACK swells it in,
    //            RELEASE lets it fade when switched off.
